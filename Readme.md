### Test Runner

The Test Runner load and runner dynamically your tests.
So each time a new test is written,
the Test Runner will detect the new file test
and attempt to run it.

### Dashboard

The Cypress Dashboard is an optional service
where all your tests are recorded (screenshots and videos) and make it easier to understand the cause of failing tests.
